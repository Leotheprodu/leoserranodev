            Hi, Iâ€™m Leonardo Serrano ðŸ‘‹

        <p>
            Howdy! I'm a Costa Rican software programmer with over <span
                class="dark:text-indigo-300 text-indigo-700"
                >3 years of web experience</span
            >. I am currently working with <span

            >; on the backend side, I am using <span
                class="dark:text-indigo-300 text-indigo-700"
                >Node.js, MySQL, and Express</span
            >. I really like creating reusable and organized code. I usually
            like to use the <span class="dark:text-indigo-300 text-indigo-700"
                >MVC design pattern</span
            >.

            I also have experience with CSS, SASS, jest, strapi, wordpress <span

            One of the things I like the most is testing and learning new
            technologies. For example, I'm currently learning <span
                class="dark:text-indigo-300 text-indigo-700">Python</span
            >, I've been trying to create things with AI with the chatGPT API,
            I've tried <span class="dark:text-indigo-300 text-indigo-700"
                >Bun</span
            >, and I'm going to start testing with <span
                class="dark:text-indigo-300 text-indigo-700">Playwright</span
            >. I'm also studying to get certified as a <span
