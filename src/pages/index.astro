        <h4 class="text-2xl dark:text-white">Hi, Iâ€™m Leonardo Serrano ðŸ‘‹</h4>
        <p>
            Howdy! I'm a Costa Rican software programmer with over <span
                class="text-indigo-600">3 years of web experience</span
            >. I am currently working with <span class="text-indigo-600"
                >NextJS/Astro, Tailwind, and Typescript</span
            >; on the backend side, I am using <span class="text-indigo-600"
                >Node.js, MySQL, and Express</span
            >. I really like creating reusable and organized code. I usually
            like to use the <span class="text-indigo-600"
                >MVC design pattern</span
            >.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have experience with CSS, SASS, jest, strapi, wordpress <span
                class="text-indigo-600">git</span
            >, github, <span class="text-indigo-600"
                >continuous deployments</span
            > in Netlify, Cpanel, Google Cloud, and more.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-2xl dark:text-white">I consider myself a nerdðŸ˜…</h4>
        <p>
            One of the things I like the most is testing and learning new
            technologies. For example, I'm currently learning <span
                class="text-indigo-600">Python</span
            >, I've been trying to create things with AI with the chatGPT API,
            I've tried <span class="text-indigo-600">Bun</span>, and I'm going
            to start testing with <span class="text-indigo-600">Playwright</span
            >. I'm also studying to get certified as a <span
                class="text-indigo-600">Cisco CCNA</span
            >.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently working as a <span class="text-indigo-600"
            ></span>freelancer, but I would also love to work for a startup and
            be part of a team. For any job <span class="text-indigo-600"
                >opportunity</span
            >, <a class="font-semibold underline" href="/contact">contact me</a
            >. I am listening to offers.
