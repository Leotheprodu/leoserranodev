            >. I really like creating reusable and organized code. I usually
            like to use the <span class="dark:text-indigo-300 text-indigo-700"
                >SOLID principles</span

            Because, I am passionate on learning and testing new technologies.

             for a backend, <span class="dark:text-indigo-300 text-indigo-700"
                >Bun
            </span> because I wanted to test how fast it is; and my next will be
